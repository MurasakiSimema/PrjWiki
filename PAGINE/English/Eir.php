$text = "The good Eir. Among the Valkyries she is certainly the most charitable: she prefers to heal dying heroes rather than lead their souls to Valhalla. In fact, it seems that there are many warriors who were rescued by Eir at the point of death, in the middle of the battle, and totally healed, returned to their families safe and in excellent health. This certainly made her the most loved and venerated among the demigods: the number of souls she led to Valhalla was much lower than the wounded she was cared for and saved from death. In the northern lands of Grand Gaia there are still numerous altars dedicated to her, and the bards sing songs about the savior of the hopeless. But the demigod's character changed much after Skalmold's betrayal: he decided ever since to fight and not just save lives. To do so, he cultivated fearsome carnivorous plants, which now haunt anyone who tries to infiltrate the woods owned by the Valkyrie. * but not for long, it will return more gigantic than ever.";
