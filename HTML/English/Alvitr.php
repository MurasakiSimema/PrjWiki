This is Alvitr, Valkyrie who unlike others does not select honorable fallen based on strength, but rather the skill, technique and elegance shown in battle. She learned some of the most advanced techniques from a hero she brought to Valhalla, considered among the best fighters ever to live in Grand Gaia. Like the other Valkyries, she took charge of the souls Skalmold neglected when the goddess failed in her duty. However, this did not seem to over-tire Alvitr, who in fact continued to refine the technique. By the time Skalmold died, Alvitr had gained formidable power, and an equally unattainable speed ... it seems that at the moment he is leading far too many souls to Valhalla! Thanks to her extraordinary ... works, Alvitr has deserved a period of vacation during which she learned about sotnarG, follow her adventures on the forum";
