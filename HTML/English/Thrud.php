$text = "Or to become an adept of Scandinavian cults, you see.<br>Daughter of a God of Thunder, Thrud is very different from the other Valkyries: she prefers combat to recovering the souls of the worthy, so much so that she enlisted a real \"army of heroes\" to follow her. She chooses the bravest and most skilled dead, as she wants to be sure that her back is covered by warriors worthy of the name. Thrud has a fiery fighting spirit, probably inherited from her father, which pushes her to fight to the end of her strength. Demonstrates an indisputable devotion to the oath taken, and though discontent or laziness occasionally spreads among other demigods, Thrud has never failed in his duty. During the fall of Skalmold, the demigod maintained a humble and loyal profile, acquiring over time powers almost comparable to those of her father.";
