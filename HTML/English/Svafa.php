Svafa holds a master's degree in recovery of the worthy drowned and therefore scours the expanses of the wide Hyperborean sea in search of sinking ships from which to extract heroes for Valhalla. Despite the quiet character, those who do not enjoy her sympathy should have the common sense to stay away from them: they have control of the seas in power, and could overwhelm a city just by wanting to. When Skalmold stopped doing his duty, Svafa also took charge of collecting the deserving souls of the mainland, which according to many exhausted her. After Skalmold's death, Svafa acquired extraordinary powers, embodying the very essence of the sea. He was also able to summon creatures from the depths from the sea using them as forces of destruction against the enemies of Valhalla. His misadventure with the octopuses is still a matter of legend.";
