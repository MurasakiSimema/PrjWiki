It leads the souls of the worthy to Valhalla, and the last image that slowly fades in the eyes of deserving heroes is represented by the arrival of Skalmold and his burning sword (another contraption to make the mythical Aem envy). It seems that the sword was given to her by a divine lover (called Surt), a god of fire who was interested in the Valkyrie. And this god, mad with love, came to give her more and more power. This fact allowed the demi-idea, already full of power, to completely neglect its duty, which at first resulted in a simple overload of work for the other keepers. But too much power soon drove her mad: she betrayed her companions, killed her lover and sowed devastation in the Hyperborean lands. The remaining guardians hunted it down, and eventually found it. They defeated her and tore her heart out of her chest.";
